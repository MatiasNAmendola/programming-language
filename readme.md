#[programming language][1] ![build status][2]
*a proposal for a new programming language.*

## usage
to get started, that is hypothetically speaking for when this project is in a
functional state (ha haa), we must download the compiler/interpreter and run
the following commands:

```python
λ def square(x) = x * x

λ square(4)
16
```

and that's it! we've just written our first program in `name undecided`.


## purpose
this is just one of those things i'm doing purely to see if i'm capable of
doing it.. don't judge me. ☺


## documentation
the documentation is all over the place right now. once i get my act together
i shall provide an index here for easy navigation throughout the language's
features and concepts. in the mean time just take a stroll through the
directories and see what you can find. think of it as and adventure! \\(:D)/
