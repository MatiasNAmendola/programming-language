#[programming language][1] ![build status][2]
*a proposal for a new programming language.*

## usage
basic variables:
```python
a int = 1
b bool = true
c string = "hello world"

print a, b, c
# 1, true, "hello world"
```

implicit variables:
```python
a = 1.0
b = true
c = "hello world"

print returns(a), returns(b), returns(c)
# float, bool, string
```

signals ( "mutable" variables ):
```python
a sig int <- 1

print a
# 1 

a <- 2

print a
# 2 
```

getting a reaction:
```python
a sig int <- 1
b int = a + 1

print a, b
# 1, 2

a <- 2

print a, b
# 2, 3
```

getting no reaction:
```python
a sig int <- 1
# capture the value of a using a()
b int = a() + 1

print a, b
# 1, 2

a <- 2

print a, b
# 2, 2
```

basic functions:
```python
# variables were functions all along
def a() int = 2
def square(x int) int = x * x

print square a
# 4

print square 4
# 16
```

currying functions:
```python
def add(x, y int) int =
  x + y

print add 2, 2
# 4

# implicit return type
def add_five = add 5

print add_five 3
# 8
```

proper signals:
```python
a sig int = input.mouse.x
b int = a + 1

# move mouse to first pixel column left
print a, b
# 1, 2

# move mouse to second pixel column from left
print a, b
# 2, 3
```

events:
```python
a evt int = input.mouse.button1
b int = a + 1

print a, b
# 0, 1

# click left mouse button
print a, b
# 1, 2
```

## keywords and symbols
### keywords
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th>keyword</th> <th>usage</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>def</td>  <td>define a function</td> </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>



### conditionals
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr> <th>keywords</th> <th>symbols</th> </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> <td>eqv</td>      <td>==</td>      </tr>
        <tr> <td>eq</td>       <td>===</td>     </tr>
        <tr> <td>lt</td>       <td>&lt;</td>    </tr>
        <tr> <td>gt</td>       <td>&gt;</td>    </tr>
        <tr> <td>le</td>       <td>&lt;=</td>   </tr>
        <tr> <td>ge</td>       <td>&gt;=</td>   </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
